# 100 Prisoners Riddle
A GUI game based on the classic puzzle, where 100 prisoners are assigned a random number and have to find the number assigned to them before 50 tries.

# How to Play
The game consists of 100 buttons numbered from 0 to 99. The player has to click on a button to check if their number matches the number on the button. If the number matches, the player wins; if the player tries 50 times without finding their number, the player loses. The game displays the result of each attempt and shows if the player has won or lost the game.
